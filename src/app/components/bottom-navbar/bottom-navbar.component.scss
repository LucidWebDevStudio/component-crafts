// When you use justify-content: space-between;,
//  it pushes flex items as far apart from each other
//   as possible, evenly distributing the available
//   space between them. This means the first item
//   sticks to the start of the container, the last
//   item sticks to the end, and the remaining items
//   are spread out with equal space between them.
